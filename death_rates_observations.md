## COVID-19 Death Rate Observations

### Key Trends
1. **Early Pandemic (2020)**:
   - Sharp initial spikes in European nations (France, UK) and the US
   - South Africa shows delayed but steep mortality curve
   - Japan/South Korea maintain <2% rates throughout

2. **Variant Waves**:
   - **Delta (Mid-2021)**: 
     - Pronounced peaks in India (~5%) and South Africa (~4.5%)
     - Moderate increases in US/Europe (~3%)
   - **Omicron (2022)**: 
     - All countries show reduced mortality (<1.5%) despite high cases

3. **Regional Comparisons**:
   - **Highest Rates**: UK peaks at ~6% (early 2020), South Africa at ~4.5% (Delta)
   - **Lowest Rates**: Australia/NZ consistently <0.5%, Japan <1.2%
   - **Divergence**: 
     - Africa/Europe show "spiky" patterns
     - Asia-Pacific has flatter curves

### Notable Country Behaviors
- **United States**: 
  - "Double peak" in 2020 (initial wave + winter surge)
  - Later waves show lower mortality
- **Brazil**: 
  - Sustained high rates during Gamma variant dominance
- **New Zealand**: 
  - Near-zero deaths until late 2021 border reopening

### Data Caveats
1. Early 2020 rates may be inflated by:
   - Limited testing (only severe cases detected)
   - Unprepared healthcare systems
2. Recent declines reflect:
   - Vaccination effects
   - Improved treatments
   - Broader case detection
