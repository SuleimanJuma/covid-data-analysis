# Infection Spikes and Variant Waves:  

- The graph shows **sharp and recurring spikes** in many countries, indicating waves of infection that correspond with:  
  - **Variant surges** (e.g., Delta, Omicron)  
  - **Policy shifts** (e.g., lockdowns, reopening)  

# High-Income Countries with Major Surges:  
- **United States, United Kingdom, and France** exhibit the **highest spikes** in daily new cases, often reaching **hundreds of thousands per day**, especially during late 2021 and early 2022.  

# India’s Dramatic Delta Wave:  
- India's new cases **peaked dramatically** during the **Delta wave (April–May 2021)**, overwhelming health systems.  
- Followed by a drop, then another surge in late 2021.  

# Middle-Income Countries with Repeated Peaks:  
- **South Africa and Brazil** also show repeated peaks, but with **slightly lower amplitudes** compared to high-income Western nations.  

# Controlled Outbreaks (Possible Underreporting):  
- **Kenya, Nigeria, Japan, and South Korea** display **lower and more controlled** daily new case curves.  
  - *(Underreporting may play a role in some regions.)*  

# Delayed but Sharp Surges in Isolated Nations:  
- **Australia and New Zealand** had **low daily cases until late 2021**, after which they saw **sharp increases** due to:  
  - Relaxed restrictions  
  - Omicron's high transmissibility  

# Key Takeaway:  
- No country was immune to resurgence, **regardless of early success** — emphasizing the **global and unpredictable nature** of the pandemic.
