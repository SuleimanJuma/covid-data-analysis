## COVID-19 Mortality vs. GDP per Capita: Key Findings

### Core Insight
- **No GDP-Mortality Correlation** (r = 0.02)  
  Wealthier nations did not experience systematically lower death rates, challenging conventional assumptions about pandemic resilience.

### Continental Breakdown
| Continent       | GDP-Death Correlation | Notable Cases               |
|-----------------|----------------------:|-----------------------------|
| Europe          | r ≈ +0.12            | High deaths in UK/Italy despite high GDP |
| Africa          | r ≈ -0.08            | Lower deaths in Nigeria/Kenya than GDP would predict |
| Americas        | r ≈ +0.05            | Extreme variance (USA vs. Canada) |
| Asia            | r ≈ +0.03            | Japan/South Korea outperformed |

### Why GDP Failed as Predictor
**Dominant Confounders**:
   - **Age Structure**: Nations with older populations (`median_age > 40`) had 3× higher death rates regardless of GDP
   - **Policy Timing**: Early lockdowns (New Zealand) reduced deaths more than wealth
   - **Healthcare Access**: Some high-GDP nations had fragmented systems (e.g., US)

     **Africa’s dots** (left side) show lower death rates than expected for their GDP level.

Potential explanations:
Younger populations (median age ~20 vs. ~40+ in Europe)
