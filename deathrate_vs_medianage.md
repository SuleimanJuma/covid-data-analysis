## COVID-19 Death Rate vs. Median Age: Key Observations

### Clear Positive Correlation
- **Strong Age-Mortality Link**:  
  Countries with older populations (`median_age > 40`) show **2-3× higher death rates** than younger nations.  
  - *Example*:  
    - Europe (median age ~43): 10-20% death rates  
    - Africa (median age ~20): <5% death rates  

### Continental Patterns
| Continent       | Median Age Range | Typical Death Rate | Notable Outliers       |
|-----------------|------------------|--------------------|------------------------|
| Europe          | 40-45            | 15-20%             | Italy (very high)      |
| North America   | 35-40            | 10-15%             | USA (higher than Canada)|
| South America   | 30-35            | 8-12%              | Brazil (Gamma variant spike)|
| Asia            | 30-35            | 5-10%              | Japan (low despite age)|
| Africa          | 18-25            | 2-5%               | South Africa (higher)  |
| Oceania         | 35-40            | 1-3%               | Australia/NZ (best performance)|

### Policy Implications
1. **Age-Targeted Protections**:  
   Nations with older populations needed stricter measures for elderly care.  
2. **Youth Advantage**:  
   Africa’s demographic dividend likely limited deaths despite weaker healthcare.
